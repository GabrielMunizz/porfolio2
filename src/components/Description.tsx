        Passionate about technology, music, and games, I also try my luck in the
        kitchen on the weekends. Since I was a child, Iâ€™ve always loved games
        and was curious about how they were made. When I studied Business
        Administration, I wrote my graduation thesis on the marketing of video
        games. After some time, I decided to go beyond curiosity and started
        learning programming, eventually entering the web development field. I
        have experience in JavaScript (React, React Native, Node, Sequelize,
        Express) and Python (Django).
