        Passionate about technology, music and games. I also try my luck in the
        kitchen on the weekends. Since I was a child, Iâ€™ve always loved games
        and was curious about how they were made. When I went to college, I wrote my graduation thesis on marketing of video
        games. Later, I decided to go further and started
        to learn how to code, focusing on web development. I
        have experience in JavaScript (React, React Native, Node, Sequelize,
        Express) and Python (Django).
